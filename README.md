//Understanding the significance of Moon rocks and building a recommendation system for Artemis Mission 2024 withe help of Microsoft Learn

Moon rocks are a huge part of the scientific discovery and understanding of our universe and planet.
They can tell us about how planets and moons were formed and guide us as we prepare for further space exploration.

Though NASA's Astromaterials Acquisition and Curation Office  has a list of all extraterrestrial samples from the Moon and elsewhere, 
this project focuses on those collected from the Moon. Across the six Apollo missions that landed humans on the Moon, and the three lunar missions that landed 
robotic probes on the Moon, we've successfully returned 383 kilograms (over 800 pounds) of rocks, soil, core samples. 
All of these samples have been categorized and photographed and are available to view on the NASA Lunar Sample and Photo Catalog.
